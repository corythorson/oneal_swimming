        <h3>Infant Lessons</h3>
        <p>Infant lessons are designed to introduce babies to the water, and begin life saving skills. Infant survival skills begin with holding their breath, grabbing and holding onto walls, flipping to their back and floating. <a href="#">more&#8230</a></p>

        <h3>Toddler Lessons</h3>
        <p>Toddler lessons are great for little swimmers who are just starting out and need to get adjusted to water. We will work pretty quickly in getting them adjusted and comfortable with the water. <a href="#">more&#8230</a></p>
