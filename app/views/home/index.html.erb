        <h3>Infant Lessons</h3>
        <p>Infant lessons are designed to introduce babies to the water, and begin life saving skills. Infant survival skills begin with holding their breath, grabbing and holding onto walls, flipping to their back and floating. <a href="/our_lessons#infant">more&#8230</a></p>

        <h3>Toddler Lessons</h3>
        <p>Toddler lessons are great for little swimmers who are just starting out and need to get adjusted to water. We will work pretty quickly in getting them adjusted and comfortable with the water. <a href="/our_lessons#toddler">more&#8230</a></p>

        <h3>Regular Lessons</h3>
        <p>Regular lessons are for those who are comfortable in the water and can blow bubbles. In this level, we focus on freestyle and backstroke. We will teach drills for front and backstroke. <a href="/our_lessons#regular">more&#8230</a></p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">A note from your instructor</h2>
        <p>The #1 Question I get as an instructor is, "How many lessons should I sign up for?" Here is how I look at it... Would you only schedule 10 lessons for Dance class or Karate? No, Swimming is a Life Skill. It takes time to learn these skills. Each child is different in the way they learn and in their swimming experience. The beauty of Private Swimming Lessons is I, as an instructor, can see the way your child needs to be taught, and see the things we need to focus more or less on, so that they master these life saving skills. Another wonderful thing is that our program is Year Round. Once your child is safe, you cannot stop! The Maintenance program is vital for young children. They forget it so fast! If you’re going to invest in this Skill, then you should know, there is no right answer to how many lessons to sign up for. This is a life skill. Don't rush it!</p>
        <p><em><strong>No Refunds, Lessons can be transferred or sold to others</strong></em></p>
